# Order Theory

This directory consists of the definition of strict orders, along with a handful
of useful instance. These are mostly used in the definition of the
[category of strict orders](../Cat/StrictOrders.agda),
as well as the definition of [displacement algebras](../Algebra/Displacement.agda)
and their various [instances](../Algebra/Algebra/Displacement/Instances/)
