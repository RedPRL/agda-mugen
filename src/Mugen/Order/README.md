# Order Theory

This directory consists of the definition of a strict order, along with a handful
of useful instance. These are mostly used in the definition of the
[category of strict orders](https://github.com/RedPRL/agda-mugen/blob/main/src/Mugen/Cat/StrictOrders.agda),
as well as the definition of [displacement algebras](https://github.com/RedPRL/agda-mugen/blob/main/src/Mugen/Algebra/Displacement.agda)
and their various [instances](https://github.com/RedPRL/agda-mugen/blob/main/src/Mugen/Algebra/Displacement/)
