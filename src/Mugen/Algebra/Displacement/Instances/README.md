# Displacement Algebras

This directory consists of instances of displacement algebras, along with their properties.
Each module begins with the machinery required for defining a displacement algebra, in the following order:
- Algebraic Structure
- Ordering
- Left Invariance

Once those are proven, we bundle up the displacement algebra, and then prove the following properties (if applicable):
- Subalgebras
- Ordred Monoid Structure
- Joins
- Bottoms
